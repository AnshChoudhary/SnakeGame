# Java Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game in Java.

## Game Rules

The player controls a snake that moves around the game board. The objective is to eat as many fruits as possible, while avoiding colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. Each time a fruit is eaten, the snake grows longer and the player earns points. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own body.
